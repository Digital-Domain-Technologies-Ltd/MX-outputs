### Testing Methodology

This audit uses three complementary perspectives:

- **Web Audit Suite** - crawl-based checks across pages: MX metadata, accessibility signals, structured data, performance, and linking patterns.
- **DOM Analysis** - rendered-page inspection using a headless browser to capture what users and assistants actually receive.
- **MX Appropriateness** - assessment of whether the site's metadata and content structure meet the MX standard for machine readability and provenance.
- **Gates** - deterministic rule checks that confirm audit integrity and flag any findings that require human review before the report is finalised.
